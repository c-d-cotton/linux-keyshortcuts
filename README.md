# Introduction
Script to output keyboard shortcuts for running shell commands. Intended to make it easier to make lots of changes at the same time and allow the potential for easier automation of generating many shortcuts.

Keychains are indicated by spacing at the start of the line.

I use the same terms and general syntax for shortcuts as in Openbox.
